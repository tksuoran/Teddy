
---- Teddy 1.80 ----


Teddy is a 3D graphics library. It implements a simple windowing
system and a simple scene graph. This is developer archive for
Teddy.

If you use Visual Studio, use the workspace file from VisualC
directory. Directory Win32libs contains libraries for VisualC
that Teddy needs. VisualC must be configured to find the files
inside the archive. No more instructions for VisualC is available
at the moment.

On unix you may choose to use either shared or static library.
Teddy configures itself into static library by default. Pass the
--enable-shared parameter to configure if you want to try shared
library version.

To build the libTeddy.a library, do the following:

	./configure && make

There is a separate directory 'Programs' which contains demo programs
that use libTeddy.a. To build these programs, do the following:

	cd Programs/TestEvents && ./configure && make &&
	more README


---- Using Teddy as shared library ----


To build the libTeddy.so shared library, do the following:

	./configure --enable-shared && make

If you did not configure with a prefix to your home directory or other
place where you have access rights, you will need to do installing as
super user:

	su
	make install
	exit

If the library installation path is not listed in /etc/ld.so.conf, you
need to add it there and run /sbin/ldconfig.

There is a separate directory 'TeddyTests' which contains demo programs
that use libTeddy.so. To build these programs, do the following:

	cd Programs/TestEvents && ./configure && make &&
	more README

This will build the programs and show usage instructions for the programs.
If the configure fails to find Teddy library, there is a problem with
pkg-config. In such case find out the correct installation location for
Teddy.pc (in Teddy-1.80) by running "which pkg-config" and replace the
/bin/pkg-config by /lib/pkgconfig. Copy Teddy.pc there and retry building
Programs.
