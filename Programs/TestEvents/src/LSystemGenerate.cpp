For those who are already familiar with l-systems, here are the commands
and their functions for this lparser's 'dialect'. All commands are 1 char
only and simpler then for most lparsers. This is to keep them from getting
'broken' by the mutation process and speeds up the parsing.

There is also the posibilty to add an argument to a command. Instead of
doing +++ one can do +(30) if the basic angle was 10 degrees. The argument
can be a real value.

The tropism command will allow you to let gravity pull branches downward by
adding a 't' element togeter with and 'F'. See the file 'tropism.ls' and
'tree*.ls' for examples. When you are not sure about the current 'down'
direction do a '$' command first. This will roll the turtle horizontal and
make sure the current up vector is oriented in the positive z-axis direction.

The turtle will start at the origin with the Z-axis as forward direction and
Y-axis as left direction. See the file 'axis.ls' for an detailed example. Here
you can experiment with the basic orientations and see how the 3d turtle is
using a 'right-handed' coordinate system. Use your right hand with your thumb
as up, forefinger as forward and an other finger as left direction.

By adding &(90) in front of an axiom the turtle axis will align with the right
handed coordinate system used in the viewer. Adding an additional +(90) will
make it easier when working with 2d l-systems. See the 'fract*.ls' files for
examples.

Values can have some randomness automatically added to them. Using ~(xx) will
now add a random direction component to the current orientation with maximum
of xx in all three directions. This way you can mark at which locations in
your l-system 'jitter' needs to be introduced. Using this option no two
'instances' of the same l-system will look the same. See fern.ls for an
example.
