	The Maths namespace contains mathematical tools useful in three
	dimensional work. Included are Vector, four-vector (Vector4)
	and Matrix. OpenGL Matrix interface is way too limited for
	serious Matrix operations, so I have replaced all modelview
	and projection Matrix manipulations.

	There is not much to say about the methods in the classes - either
	you are familiar with them or not. Understading some linear algebra
	helps a great deal.
