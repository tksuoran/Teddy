/*! \page page_registering Registering to Teddy project and mailintlist at Sourceforge

First you should <a href="http://sourceforge.net/account/register.php">
register yourself at sourceforge</a> and let me know your sourceforge unix
name so I can add you to the team. At the moment our team is small. Anyone
who is willing to contribute is welcome.

Also join the <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/teddy-deve">
Teddy developers' mailinglist</a>. There has been hardly any traffic at all there
yet, so don't be afraid of getting flooded. I would very much like to use the mailing
list for all Teddy related discussion as primary forum and media.
